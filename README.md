# GENUS

GENUS is a mobile-first website created to bring gamers together. Gaming is an art, a sport, a lifestyle. Video games have been around for over 4 decades and have evolved considerably. Nowadays games are used in various ways to enhance skills, blow off steam after a long day or relax during time off.

Genus has been designed with gamers at its core. Visitors will be welcome with information about our community and our ethos. They will find information about our various channels such as Twitch, YouTube or Discord. They will be able to browse through our gallery to see what and how we play video games. They will also find a contact us form to send us any queries and additional information of other channels available to reach us. 

The primary goal of this website is to inform users of who we are and what we do and why they should join us.

Genus was created for my Milestone 1 project in the Full Stack Web Development course I am currently undertaking at Code Institute.

## UX
UX design and principle were central and of the utmost importance for the development of this website. The five planes were used when planning the website structure and content and throughout the building of the website.

# Strategy Plane
### Client Goals
* As a client I was a website to increase awareness of my community.
* As a client, I was a clever platform where I can engage with my visitors.
* As a client, I want to offer my visitors an excellent user experience that will make them want to return.
* As a client, I will look for information that is displayed and conveyed accordingly to persuade users to join my community.

## User Stories
* As a visitor, I want to understand what audience the website is targeting.
* As a visitor, I want to find information about the GENUS community and what it has to offer.
* As a visitor, I want to navigate the website easily and find what I need.
* As a visitor, I want to see pictures of people playing video games together.
* As a visitor, I want to find social media links to be able to enjoy what GENUS has to offer.
* As a visitor, I want to be able to get in touch to get my queries solved.

## Opportunity Goal Table

At the early stages of the development, the opportunities for the website were determined and ranked according to their viability and importance.

| 8. Online forum | 4 | 1 |
| 8. Offer live support | 4 | 1 |


# Scope Plane

Whilst working on the strategy stage of the development, features were verified against the viability and importance criteria. This ensured the project will not go beyond its short-term goals, therefore each feature has been categorised for immediate or future releases. The table below highlights each feature and its release date.

| Feature | Release | 
| ----------- | ---------- | 
| Develop an online presence | 1|
| Increase social media following | 1 |
| Promote the community | 2 |
| Promote giveaways and contests | 2 |
| Increase user feedback | 1| 
| Provide contact information | 1|
| Online forum | 3 | 
| Offer live support | 3 |

## Existing Features

## Wireframes

This project has had its wireframes developed using [Figma](https://www.figma.com/)

| Mobile | Tablet| Desktop|
--------------------|--------------------|--------------------------|
| [Mobile Home Page](assets/readme-images/mobile-homapge.png) | [Tablet Home Page](assets/readme-images/tablet-homepage.png) | [Desktop Home Page](assets/readme-images/desktop-homepage.png) |
| [Mobile Community Page](assets/readme-images/mobile-community.png) | [Tablet Community Page](assets/readme-images/tablet-community.png) | [Desktop Community Page](assets/readme-images/desktop-community.png) |
| [Mobile Gallery](assets/readme-images/mobile-gallery.png) | [Tablet Gallery Page](assets/readme-images/tablet-gallery.png) | [Desktop Gallery Page](assets/readme-images/desktop-gallery.png) |
| [Mobile Contact Us Page](assets/readme-images/contact-us.png) | [Tablet Contact Us Page](assets/readme-images/tablet-contact-us.png) | [Desktop Contact Us Page](assets/readme-images/desktop.contact-us.png) |

## Changes to Wireframes
Throughout the development of the website, some changes have been made.

1. Landing page newsletter form 
  * The sign-up form on the landing page has been removed as the newsletter is yet to be implemented.

2. Twitch Stream Iframe 
  * The Twitch iframe has been removed from the community page as it was unnecessary content. Visitors still have the option to access our Twitch stream from the footer of the website.

3. The founder section
  * The Founder section has been moved from the Contact Us page to the community page as given its content and purpose it was more suited to the community page.

4. Contact Us page newsletter form
  * The newsletter application form has been removed as it is yet to be implemented and will be pushed back in later updates.

5. Business and user enquiries
  * The business and partnership section has been merged with the additional communication channels for members and visitors and both serve the same purpose and having them separately was pointless.

# Surface Plane
 The colour palette choice was thought of as a representation of positivity and belongingness.

## Colour Pallete

During the initial development, a choice of warm colours was used to be more pleasant and welcoming to our visitors.

The initial colour palette was chosen using [Coolors.](https://coolors.co/)

After the development was finished the colour palette was altered, the below colours being used as definitive choices.
