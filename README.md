Video games have been around for over 4 decades and have evolved considerably. Nowadays games are used in various ways to enhance skills, blow off steam after a long day or relax during time off.

Genus has been designed with gamers at its core. Visitors will be welcome with information about our community and our ethos. They will find information about our various channels such as Twitch, YouTube or Discord. They will be able to browse through our gallery to see what and how we play video games. They will also find contact us form to send us any queries and additional information of other channels available to reach us. 

The primary goal of this website is to inform users of who we are and what we do and why they should join us.
