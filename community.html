            <h3>Killer Cat</h3>
            <p>I've been a member of this lovely community for over a year and I don't regret joining it for a second. It has an active player base and you can always get advice on any topic, not only gaming related. I also love watching their Twitch stream, top quality content and a good laugh.</p>
            <h3>The Beast</h3>
            <p>I joined GENUS 6 months ago as I was looking for an active community with a large player base. I was amazed to see how welcoming and friendly the community players are. There are frequent contests and giveaways, which is something I'm thrilled about.</p>

            <p>Hello Everyone. My name is Favius and I'm 24. I've had a thing for video games from a young age. I started gaming on a GameBoy, then on some Nintendo knockoffs. On pc I started with Captain Claw and Disney's Hercules. I created this community for gamers to share thoughts, opinions, ask for advice and game with others.  </p>
